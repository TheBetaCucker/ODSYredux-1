# OdysseyNow

A group project by students and faculty at the University of Pittsburgh.

The game is meant to be played with our analog controllers, however, keyboard controls are also available.

Eventually, the game will be packaged into an executable, but for we just have java files that require a little extra work to run.

# Controls


  Player 1
  
  WASD controls movement
  
  Adjust Ball English with 2 and 3
  
  Reset with R
  
  Player 2
  
  Arrow keys control movement
  
  Adjust Ball English with . and /
  
  Reset with ,
  
  Cycle through games with [ and ]
  
  Increase Ball Speed with T
  
  Decrease Ball Speed with Y
  
  
  
  Exit the game with ESCAPE

# How to run a java file
1.  Theoretically, the program should be updated so that all you need to do to run is double click BUILD and double click LAUNCH on a Windows machine.  Mac and Linux compatibility is upcoming.  If this doesn’t work, you may not have a Java Runtime environment installed.  Check the documentation for more information.
